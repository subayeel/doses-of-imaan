            <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              Let's explore something really important—how we can know if
              Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was truly sent by God. If you've already seen
              how the Quran is divine, this becomes simpler, because the Quran
              clearly states:
            </p>

            <div className="bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 rounded-lg p-6 my-8 border-l-4 border-purple-300 dark:border-purple-600">

                "Say, [O Muhammad], 'O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of
                Allah to you all.'"

              <p className="text-right text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">

              But let's take a different approach too. When someone makes a big
              claim like being a prophet, there are really only three
              possibilities to consider:

                  He genuinely thought he was a prophet but was confused or

                When Muhammad's ﷺ young son Ibrahim died, there happened to be a
                solar eclipse on the same day. Many people thought this was a
                divine sign mourning the death of the Prophet's son.

              <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                If Muhammad ﷺ was deluded or dishonest, this would have been a
                perfect opportunity to reinforce his claim to prophethood.
                Instead, he gathered people and said:

                  someone from the people, but they are two signs amongst the
                  signs of God. When you see them, stand up and pray."
