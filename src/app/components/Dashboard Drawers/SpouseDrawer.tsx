              Marriage in Islam isn't just a social contract‚Äîit's a sacred bond
              where both husband and wife are garments for one another, offering
              protection, comfort, and dignity. Knowing each other's rights
              helps strengthen love, prevents harm, and ensures fairness and
              harmony in family life.

              Islam reminds us that marriage is not about power or control. It's
              about love, support, and a shared journey toward Jannah. Each
              right comes with responsibility, and when both spouses seek to
              please Allah, their marriage becomes a form of worship. üåü
