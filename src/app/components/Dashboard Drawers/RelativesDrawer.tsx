            <CardDescription>
              The concept of silat al-rahim (maintaining family ties) is so
              significant in Islam that Allah links it to His mercy. Discover
              how nurturing extended family relationships, even with
              differences, becomes an act of worship that brings baraka (divine
              blessing) into your life and lengthens your provision, as the
              Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught.
