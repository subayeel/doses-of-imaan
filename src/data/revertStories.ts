  age: 17,
  background:
    "My mom is an English lady from a Christian background who believes in something but isn't part of an organized religion. My father comes from a Punjabi Sikh background. I grew up in a liberalism-focused household. I always had a general sense of God but wasn't a member of any religion.",
  journey:
    "When I was about 15, I started exploring different religions. I looked into the oldest religions, Egyptian belief systems, Hinduism, Judaism, and finally Islam. I came from an Islamophobic background that was quite hostile towards Islam. It was only when a Muslim friend suggested I read the Quran that I decided to give it a chance.",
  quranExperience:
    "Initially, I thought the Quran would be like any other holy book with God asserting authority over everyone. However, as I read it daily, I built an attachment to it. The simplicity of its style, its directness, clear moral messages, and common-sensical nature of Allah's guidance really drew me in. After reading the Quran, I essentially believed in Islam.",
  shahada:
    "I called my friend immediately and said I needed to become Muslim right away. I took my shahada just after my 17th birthday in October, which gave me a full year before Ramadan. I did my shahada with my friend, his uncle, his two aunties, and some people from Somalia on Skype.",
  challenges:
    "I kept my conversion a secret from my parents for roughly 2 years. I didn't have a job or money to buy Halal food. Prayer wasn't as difficult as I was out often and could go to the mosque, but food was a major problem. During Ramadan, I had little to eat except dates and snacks at the mosque. Eventually, a brother who owned a restaurant found out and offered me meals.",
  advice:
    "Ramadan can be an incredibly lonely time for converts. My advice for new Muslims would be to connect with people, as there is an obligation on people to support you, but it's also your responsibility to reach out. Pace yourself—it's a long journey to build your Iman and cleanse yourself of past habits. Focus on your fast and developing a relationship with Allah through fasting and Dua.",

  background:
    "I have a background in psychology with a master's degree and PhD. Before my PhD, I worked as a clinician. I was always driven to understand human nature, particularly from a developmental standpoint. I used to travel extensively and read about different religious traditions.",
  journey:
    "I traveled to many places seeking truth. I studied with a Hindu yoga teacher named Baba Hari Dass who had taken a 40-year vow of silence and taught me on a chalkboard. I practiced yoga, meditation, and pranayama (breathing practices). Though I resonated with the practical aspects, the theological elements of Hinduism didn't connect with me. I then practiced Buddhism, lived in Thailand studying with a Buddhist monk in the jungle, and spent time in Jamaica with a Rastafarian elder learning about their spiritual traditions. I also lived as a shepherd in Palestine, sleeping on hay bales and tending to sheep and goats. In each place, I felt I had an internal barometer for truth, absorbing what resonated while recognizing what didn't align, particularly in matters of theology (aqeedah).",
  islamExperience:
    "Ironically, after traveling the world, I encountered Islam in California through Sheikh Mohammed Jamal, who was the caretaker of Al-Aqsa mosque. What struck me was how his Muslim community treated me—they practiced Islam faithfully but didn't judge my spiritual state or insist I believe as they did. They recognized that only Allah could judge my soul's condition. This was revolutionary to me after encountering so much tribalism in other traditions where righteousness depended on bloodlines, social identity, or specific behaviors.",
  shahada:
    "My conversion wasn't a rational decision based on reading, but a moment when Allah turned my heart. Everything suddenly clicked, and I realized that all the spiritual gems I had collected throughout my journey were present within Islam, along with the framework (Sharia) that connected everything. I embraced Islam, and this simultaneously became my approach to psychology.",

  background:
    "Australian man who began searching for religious truth after experiencing personal losses - the death of his dog and watching a friend slowly die from cancer over an eight-month period. People kept telling him God loved him, but he questioned this, thinking 'God killed my dog'.",
  journey:
    "He decided to investigate religions to find truth for himself. He first attended a Christian church but felt out of place and didn't connect with their teachings. He then explored Hinduism, questioning their multiple gods and specifically joking about Ganesha. He also investigated Judaism but didn't find what he was looking for. He was initially drawn to Buddhism, appreciating its philosophy as 'not so much a religion of God but just a good way to live.' When someone suggested Islam, he initially dismissed it with Islamophobic views, thinking Muslims were terrorists, but eventually decided to visit Preston mosque.",
  mosqueTakeover:
    "His first visit to the mosque was awkward - he walked across prayer rugs with shoes on and nearly stepped on someone in sujud. He met Abu Hamza and was surprised by the hospitality, being repeatedly offered tea despite his refusals. What impressed him was how the Muslims always answered his questions directly from the Quran rather than personal opinion. He was surprised to find nothing in the Quran about violence or terrorism, contrary to his preconceptions. He found the Muslims to be 'the most hospitable, caring, nice people' who offered community support.",
  signFromAllah:
    "One night, he decided to ask Allah for a sign to confirm his path. He waited for dramatic signs like lightning or some obvious miracle, but nothing happened. Disappointed, he turned the page in the Quran and found a verse stating that for those who ask for signs, Allah has already shown enough - in the sky, stars, land, and oceans. This was a transformative moment, realizing he had been arrogant to ask for specific signs when signs were all around him already in creation.",
  shahada:
    "The next day, he went to the mosque to take his Shahada. Coincidentally, it was the first night of Ramadan, so the mosque was packed with about a thousand people. Despite being nervous about pronouncing the Arabic words correctly, he stood before what he describes as 'a sea of beards' and recited the Shahada. He felt a profound spiritual experience - 'like a shower had been turned on and my whole body had been flush clean.'",
  reactionOfCommunity:
    "After his Shahada, the community erupted in celebration with 'Takbir' (saying Allahu Akbar). The brothers hugged and kissed him, many with tears in their eyes. He immediately felt a sense of brotherhood with people he had never met before, as if he had known them for 30 years. He realized he now had 'more brothers and sisters than he could ever have imagined.'",
  advice:
    "He encourages others to investigate all religions, particularly Islam. He concludes with one of his favorite verses from the Quran: 'Let there be no compulsion in religion, because the truth stands clear from error.'",

  previousReligion: "Hinduism",
  age: 27,
  background:
    "Born and raised in a Hindu family in India. His parents were devout Hindus who built temples. His father was a diplomat in the Indian government, which gave the family VIP status. He was uncomfortable with the privilege this gave him at temples, where he could bypass long queues of poor worshippers. He attended a Christian school (Don Bosco) from preschool, where he also participated in Christian worship.",
  religiousUpbringing:
    "He describes his Hindu upbringing as focused on the superficial aspects - festivals, food, and glamour - with 'nothing at the core of the heart that got connected.' His family had statues in their house and regularly attended temple. Through his Christian schooling, he also participated in church services, getting 'down on our knees on the bench and worship Jesus Christ.'",
  islamophobia:
    "He was extremely islamophobic before his conversion. Whenever he saw someone with a beard and kufi, he thought 'this guy is going to either kill me, he's going to stab me.' He attributes this to media portrayal in his country, where butcher shops run by bearded Muslims and movie depictions created fear. He states that people were 'scared only by looking at the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad' without having read the Quran or hadith.",
  materialismAndVoid:
    "He describes himself as having been very materialistic, with high ambitions for luxury items like '40-50 pairs of shoes and watches' and fancy cars. However, he was never satisfied after acquiring these things, always asking 'what's next?' He experienced 'a very toxic relationship within myself' and 'always this void within myself' that materialism couldn't fill.",
  conversionExperience:
    "In November 2017, at age 27, he experienced what he describes as a full-body paralysis at 2 AM (similar to sleep paralysis). Only his tongue and head could move. He panicked and called out to every god he had ever worshipped, including Hindu deities and Jesus, but received no relief. After about 15 minutes of suffering, his tongue involuntarily said 'Allahu Akbar' - and immediately his body was released from the paralysis. He was shocked because Allah was 'the only thing that I was scared of in pertaining to Islam.'",
  aftermath:
    "After the experience, he felt an unprecedented calm. He researched what 'Allahu Akbar' meant, and by the next morning, he took his shahada (declaration of faith in Islam). He emphasizes that his conversion happened 'without any human intervention' - no Muslims had given him dawah (invitation to Islam), and he had no Muslim friends who spoke to him about the religion.",
  reflections:
    "He compares his faith to something 'beyond the heavens and the Earth' that no Muslim should sell 'even for a billion dollars.' He delayed sharing his revert story for about four years (from 2017 to 2021) due to internal struggles, but eventually decided to share it hoping that 'this beautiful story might spark people's heart.'",
  physicalAttributes:
    "He describes himself as 'physically a very active guy' who was 'very crazy about diet and six-pack.'",
  education:
    "MBA in Finance and Islamic Finance, though he notes the irony that his Islamic finance education happened before his conversion to Islam.",

  background:
    "From India, raised in a Hindu family that wasn't very practicing but was 'rigid in their belief.' Religion was always a source of confusion for her, and religious practices were done 'just for the sake of doing it.' Although there were Muslims in her community in India, she never interacted with them during her 23 years there.",
  islamophobia:
    "Growing up, she was taught that Muslims were 'not good people,' that 'terrorism is related to them,' that 'they are terrorists' and to 'stay away from them.' This prejudice kept her from interacting with Muslims in her community in India.",
  firstMuslimEncounter:
    "Her perspective began to change when she moved to the UAE and worked in businesses where she had Muslim and Pakistani colleagues. Their kindness contradicted what she had been taught: 'They were very good and that was the time that I realized these are really nice people.' She emphasizes that it was 'their nice behavior that first attracted me towards the people, not to the religion.'",
  learningJourney:
    "After being impressed by Muslims' character, she began investigating Islam by picking up books at Islamic centers that answered 'basic questions that you have in mind about Islam or God or the Creator.' She also researched online. This learning process took approximately one year before she accepted Islam.",
  spiritualTurningPoint:
    "A significant moment came when she first held the Quran. She describes an overwhelming emotional experience: 'When I took the Quran in my hand, I literally... I cried and cried and cried holding it. I just cried. I cried for I don't know more than half an hour I just kept crying.'",
  challenges:
    "She alludes to difficult life circumstances where 'Allah takes away everything from you to show that okay now... what are you going to do?' She believes Allah gave her strength during this time: 'I think that Allah had put that strength in me at that point of time that I will not step back no matter what.'",
  transformation:
    "She describes Islam as having made her 'more strong as a person.' She contrasts her previous materialism ('I have my parents, I have that car, I have so much money') with a spiritual realization that came after accepting Islam: 'There are times in your life when you will have to beg in front of your creator. He will make you fall so that you beg in front of him... where all your ego and all your strength and power and money will fail.'",

  background:
    "Born in a Hindu Brahmin family in England. Raised between England and India. His uncle, who had three daughters but no sons, died when he was around 15 years old.",
  catalystForJourney:
    "As the son of his uncle's elder brother, he was considered the 'eldest son' for ritual purposes and was tasked with performing the final funeral rites for his uncle in Banaras (Varanasi). According to Hindu tradition, he participated in cremation rituals and saw his uncle's ashes. This profound experience with death made him realize the impermanence of life: 'It kind of struck me that life is at least the way we think of it is very impermanent and the whole idea of death as being so close was something that really really struck me.'",
  spiritualSearch:
    "From the age of about 15, he began researching what different traditions believe about death and the afterlife. He first explored his own Hindu tradition, examining concepts of rebirth and karma. He then studied other religions including Judaism and Christianity before finally looking into Islam, which he admits was 'probably last possible religion I would have been looking at' due to its 'bad publicity.'",
  discoveryOfIslam:
    "When he began studying Islam, he was surprised by what he found. He discovered that the Quran has 'a whole chapter on Mary' and mentions figures like Abraham, Noah, and Jesus. This contradicted his expectations about Islam being solely an Arabian religion. A new understanding emerged for him: 'God is one and the essence of his path of submitting to that Oneness is one and he has been sending different prophets, different Messengers to each and every nation from the beginning of time until now.'",
  realizations:
    "He contrasts the Islam he discovered through his research with the Islam portrayed in media: 'It doesn't fit the Islam that I'm reading in Reader's Digest or... the Islam that you see on television.' He describes finding 'a deeper Islam... the Islam of the Soul' that resonated with him on a profound level.",
  conversion:
    "His discovery of Islam led to a life-changing decision to become Muslim. He describes his conversion as 'just a coming home,' suggesting that Islam felt familiar to him: 'This is me, this is a part of me, this is what I've always known somehow somewhere I should be doing.'",

    "He grew up in a predominantly Christian environment and spent several decades searching for the purpose of life before finding Islam.",
  journey:
    "His spiritual search lasted 11 years, during which he explored many philosophical systems, religions, and ideologies. He was initially drawn to humanitarian work and studied figures like Mahatma Gandhi. He spent time with Buddhists and learned meditation, but was disappointed when told the purpose of life was to 'contemplate the Supreme nothingness.' He also explored Christianity more deeply by approaching a theologian at a church, but was frustrated when told to consider a four-year theology degree instead of receiving a direct answer. He investigated astronomy which led him to contemplate the magnificence of creation and the likelihood of a purpose for human existence. Throughout his journey, he visited different countries and spoke with hundreds of people from various religious and cultural backgrounds.",

    "After meeting a Muslim girlfriend who wouldn't allow him to visit her due to religious reasons, he approached the Islamic Society where he was given Islamic books to read. He read them all within two weeks and became convinced by Islam.

My family was deeply religious - my sister was a Third Order Carmelite nun and several of my uncles were priests. Our whole life centered around the church, including catechism, confirmation classes, and teaching youth groups. I was taught that Jesus was God, and I considered him my best friend.",
  journey:
    "My journey began when I went to work at the American Embassy in Saudi Arabia, setting up a childcare preschool. I initially went with the intention to spread Christianity, as my priest had encouraged me to bring Bibles and teach the 'love of Jesus' to people there. However, I was surprised to discover that many Muslims knew more about Jesus and the Bible than I did. They told me beautiful stories about Mary (Maryam) and Jesus that weren't in the Bible, like the miracle of Jesus speaking as an infant. I was particularly moved by Surah Maryam in the Qur'an. I also witnessed the adhan (call to prayer) while in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and had a profound spiritual experience on a mountain where I felt there was 'something in this land' that produced prophets. I returned to America still identifying as Christian, but deeply changed. I later saw part of the movie 'The Message' about Prophet Muhammad, which further sparked my interest.",
  islamExperience:
    "When I returned home and began talking about Islam and Prophet Muhammad, my family became concerned. My sister who was a nun took me to different priests, bishops, and even monks to convince me to abandon these thoughts. For seven years, I met with a monk from India who had studied with Muslims, but instead of being discouraged, I became more convinced of Islam's truth. During this period, many people close to me passed away - my parents, my priest, and eventually the monk himself. Finally, I met a priest named Father Tom who told me that even if it cost him his position in the church, he had to tell me to follow what God was telling me in my heart, not what others (including church officials up to the Pope) were saying.",
  shahada:
    "I eventually took my shahada at a Palestinian mosque with my two younger children (I had four children total - the older two were raised Catholic, and the younger two became Muslim with me). A Palestinian woman at the mosque taught me how to pray, physically guiding me into sujood (prostration). The moment my head touched the ground in prostration was deeply moving and humbling - I couldn't stop crying and realized I had never experienced anything like this in church.",
  challenges:
    "My family strongly opposed my conversion. My sister who was a nun was particularly determined to 'fix' me and took me to specialists, monks, and priests. The church's opposition was even more difficult than my family's. I was shown a lot of negativity and faced propaganda against Islam for seven years. One monk became so upset when I brought him an English Qur'an that he threw it across the room at me, though he later apologized on his deathbed.",
  advice:
    "For those considering conversion: Don't wait once you know the truth. Don't fear taking your shahada - it will only bring blessings. Don't listen to what you hear about Islam in the media; research it yourself or learn from Muslims directly. Your example of how you live your life as a Muslim will speak louder than preaching. Even if you feel you might lose your family, you'll gain a much better family in the Muslim ummah. For explaining Islam to Christian family: Tell them you didn't leave Jesus and Mary; you got to know them even better as a Muslim and love them more deeply now.",

As a child, he was very passionate about his faith, attended church every Sunday, participated in Bible study and church choir. He got his first Bible at age 12 and tried several times to read it from front to back.",
  journey:
    "During his teenage years, he began questioning his faith due to political and theological issues. A pivotal moment came at a Presbyterian youth conference called 'Triennial,' where he was disappointed by the behavior of other young Christians who were sneaking in alcohol and 'hooking up.' He also disagreed with a pro-LGBTQ presentation given at the conference. He felt the Christian practice of attending church once a week wasn't 'thick enough' or 'weighty enough.' By age 16, he identified as an atheist, believing religion was just 'fairy tales people tell each other to make themselves feel better.' In college, he was a political science major specializing in international relations where he encountered Islam through a Moroccan professor who taught courses about the intersection of Islam and politics.",

Despite warnings from secular Turkish students that he might be treated poorly as a non-Muslim in a conservative area, he found the opposite - people were extremely kind and helpful. As a former musician, he was deeply moved by the adhan (call to prayer), saying 'I would cry, to be honest. I would hear the adhan and I would just cry.' After returning to the US, he began experimenting with Muslim worship, trying salat (prayer) and fasting, which he loved.",
  signFromAllah:
    "What convinced him that Islam was true was its approach to textual authenticity. Having seen how the Bible had been changed over centuries, he was impressed by Islam's rigorous preservation of texts. He found substantial evidence for the Quran's authenticity, noting 'there's over 50 manuscripts that can be carbon dated back to the time of the Prophet (saw) - 97% of the Qur'an that we have today.'",
  shahada:

The experience was mixed - he was taken to a basement alone with someone whose role wasn't clear, and after a few general statements about Islam, he took the shahada. Meanwhile, his wife (who wasn't ready to convert) was told upstairs that 'every touch between you two is haram now,' which created tension.",

His wife was supportive even before her own conversion, buying him a prayer rug and Quran recordings. She later converted before they moved to Medina, where he studied at the Islamic University.",
  advice:
    "He emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Islam as what impressed him most - how it provides specific guidance for every aspect of life, from personal spirituality to social and economic systems. He advises non-Muslims that 'the definition of religion is what God wants from us, nothing else' and that believers must take responsibility for being as certain as possible that they are doing what God wants.
